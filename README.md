# Vegas Craps with the Kid
Father/Daughter team up to tackle coding!  
Long time listener, first time caller.  
We are creating a desktop Vegas Craps game using Python.  Starting out with a simple street craps version, and then adding in layers as we go. 
Street Craps code is complete.  No formatting yet, and no html yet. Just simple Python code.
Giggity!
